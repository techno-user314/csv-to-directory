Use this directory to store image files for each family.  
The images should be .jpg files named in one of the following formats:
  - 'lastname firstname.jpg'
  - 'lastname firstname family.jpg'
Where lastname is the family lastname, and firstname is the firstname of the primary member of the family (primary member as defined in the 'Family Relationship' field of the CSV).  
If the person is single, 'family' may be dropped from the filename, as shown above.
